      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Rachelle van Uden, a Multimedia specialist from 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands. My work focuses on capturing
        the unique identity of my subjects, influenced by culture and personal background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up between Dutch and Surinamese cultures, I'm fascinated by identity and how it's shaped by the world
        around us. In my photography, I strive to showcase the beauty of each individual.
